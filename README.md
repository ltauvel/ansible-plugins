## action_plugins

Action plugins act in conjunction with modules to execute the actions required by playbook tasks. They usually execute automatically in the background doing prerequisite work before modules execute.

## callback_plugins

Callback plugins enable adding new behaviors to Ansible when responding to events. By default, callback plugins control most of the output you see when running the command line programs.

## filter_plugins

Filter plugins are used for manipulating data. They are a feature of Jinja2 and are also available in Jinja2 templates used by the template module. As with all plugins, they can be easily extended, but instead of having a file for each one you can have several per file.

## modules

Ansible modules are reusable, standalone scripts that can be used by the Ansible API, or by the ansible or ansible-playbook programs. They return information to ansible by printing a JSON string to stdout before exiting.
